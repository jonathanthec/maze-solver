## Maze Solver
Welcome to my Maze Solver! This project will allow you to visualize how different search algorithms work in progress. It is simple to use and is a work in progress. You can directly drag and drop starting and finishing locations, placing wall objects, and choose the speed and type of algorithms that you'd like to see. The deployed project is here: https://jonathanthec.github.io/maze-solver/

## Motivation
When I was first learning about various searching algorithms, I had a difficult time visualizing them in my head, so I thought an actual visualization tool would help me out.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- React.js

## Features
- Draggable starting and finishing locations
- CSS animation effects to showcase the pathfinding progress
- Features three different pathfinding algorithms

## Upcoming Features
- A fourth algorithm will be added soon

## Installation
To run this program locally, start with `yarn start`

## How to use?
Refer to the guide at https://jonathanthec.github.io/maze-solver/
